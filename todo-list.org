The things need to be done to convert =metropolis= to =metropolistoken=.

* Naming [7/7]
  Change every instance of =metropolis= to =metropolistoken= (from the file names to the
  file contents).

* Others/Cleaning [0/5]
  - [ ] Write README accordingly
    - [ ] Rewrite README
    - [ ] Instruction on how to install
    - [ ] Tested on what machine?
  - [ ] Delete NEWS?
  - [ ] Look at the =demo.tex=. Looks like there are some cool stuff in there.
  - [ ] Try to produce =*.sty= file by run Latex directly on =source/bemaerthememetropolitoken.ins=.
        Take care of the =logo.jpg= file.
  - [ ] Try to check if this theme is affected in any way with the introduction of the
        =logo.jpg= file

* NOTE
  - Although the =logo.jpg= file problem is basically, solved, a more elegant way
    is needed. The files that are affected by this are (probably):
    1. =Makefile=
    2. =source/bemaerthememetropolitoken.ins=
