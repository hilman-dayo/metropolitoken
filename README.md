Being an Emacs and org-mode guy, I want to do everything in text file, even with my every week presentation
(as a Ph.D. student I need to report to my supervisor every week).
For me, [Metropolis](http://github.com/matze/mtheme) is the best theme out there for Latex Beamer.
So, I forked and made some minor changes to it. Basically, it becomes an official template for my
laboratory presentation slide.

I also give it a new name: **Metropolitoken**.
